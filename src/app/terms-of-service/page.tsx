            <p>
              In accordance with EU consumer protection laws, you have the right to cancel your order within 14 days of receiving the products without giving any reason (the &quot;cooling-off period&quot;).

              To exercise this right, you must inform us of your decision to cancel your order in an unambiguous statement. You must then return the products to us without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate your cancellation.

              You will be responsible for the cost of returning the products unless they are defective or not as described.

            <p>
              We strive to ensure all products meet high-quality standards. However, due to the nature of 3D printing, minor variations in color, texture, and finish may occur.
            </p>
            <p>
              For customized products created based on your specifications, the cooling-off period does not apply as per EU regulations for personalized goods.
